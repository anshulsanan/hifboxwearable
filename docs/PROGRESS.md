I have successfully purchased a development board that features the FXAS21002 3-Axis gyroscope. This is a [development board](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=FRDM-STBC-AGM01) from NXP Semiconductors that features the FXAS21002 3-Axis gyroscope and FXOS8700C 6-axis sensor with a integrated linear accelerometer and magnetometer. These additional sensors will be used in the following semester to implement fall detection. The total cost of the order is $36.06 USD with $20.00 USD for the shipping costs. This order is expected to arrive by the 29th of October. To ensure I receive a working development board I have ordered two in the event one is defective. Information regarding the board can be found [here](http://cache.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/support_info/FRDM-STBC-AGM01-QRC.pdf).

So far I have acquired a Raspberry Pi B+ and have installed Raspbian successfully. SSH has been configured to allow for X11 Forwarding to facilitate the viewing of graphical applications on the controlling machine. Unfortunately, at this time, I am unable to acquire the gyroscope breakout board from Adafruit because they are out of stock. A reseller called Elmwood Electronics offers the [same breakout board](https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/products/adafruit-precision-nxp-9-dof-breakout-board-fxos8700-fxas21002), however they are also sold out. I've been watching both sellers daily to seize the item as soon as they restock, but I haven't had any luck. In attempt to catch the item restocked I've also added myself to a email notification subscription for both sellers.

For the time being I will be writting the application for the target ARM platform and analyzing the communications using an oscilloscope. If the breakout board does not become available in the near future I will have to either order the gyroscope standalone and build the breakout board, or use a similar sensor breakout board that's available.
No additional expenses have been required for the construction of this project. So far all materials used were acquired some time before the project's inception.

The Raspbian distribution for the Raspberry Pi has been successfully flashed to the target SD. Intially I experienced issues with the SSH server's configuration file. Since the configuration file was modified incorrectly when the service was tasked to reload it failed to start, even when enabled to boot during startup.
