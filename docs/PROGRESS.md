# Progress
## Date: October 23, 2018
So far I have acquired a Raspberry Pi B+ and have installed Raspbian successfully. SSH has been configured to allow for X11 Forwarding to facilitate the viewing of graphical applications on the controlling machine. Unfortunately, at this time, I am unable to acquire the gyroscope breakout board from Adafruit because they are out of stock. A reseller called Elmwood Electronics offers the [same breakout board](https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/products/adafruit-precision-nxp-9-dof-breakout-board-fxos8700-fxas21002), however they are also sold out. I've been watching both sellers daily to seize the item as soon as they restock, but I haven't had any luck. In attempt to catch the item restocked I've also added myself to a email notification subscription for both sellers.

For the time being I will be writting the application for the target ARM platform and analyzing the communications using an oscilloscope. If the breakout board does not become available in the near future I will have to either order the gyroscope standalone and build the breakout board, or use a similar sensor breakout board that's available.
No additional expenses have been required for the construction of this project. So far all material used were acquired some time before the project's inception.
